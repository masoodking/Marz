# Berim Social Network (BSN) API
## Editing
for change this api you should know yaml or json. in the root path we have 2 file api.json and api.yaml that you can open it in http://editor.swagger.io/ (Menu->File->Import File or simply copy paset it to editor) and work on that. after change or add methods you can export nodejs server on your local and run it localy for using test functions of this api to check your methods.

before working on anything get last version of api from this repository and after any change please push your json and yaml file to rhis repository. Please don't change nodejs project and just change api.json and api.yaml file (both), and I'll apply changes on nodejs project.

Take a look and ask any questionâ€¦
